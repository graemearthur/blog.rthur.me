technology partners at work. They are presenting to the &lt;a href="http://www.faa.gov/">FAA&lt;/a>
and need to explain how we (&lt;a href="http://www.flightdataservices.com">Flight Data Services&lt;/a>)
can replay the data from tens of thousands of flights in extremely short order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, I went looking for a good tool to draw the diagram. I&amp;rsquo;ve
tried several in the past and never really been satisfied. I found
&lt;a href="http://www.draw.io/about.html">draw.io&lt;/a> and it is really good.
This is how they describe it.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.draw.io/">draw.io&lt;/a> is an online diagramming application
and github project. It features the full range of visual configuration
you expect, as well as web application features such as a full range of
export options, a large collection of icons, real-time collaboration
and embedded widget sharing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The shape library is extensive and pretty consistent. I was able
to export the diagram in the formats I wanted. Overall, it&amp;rsquo;s not
half bad and completely free.&lt;/p></description><summary>A web based data flow diagram application</summary></item></channel></rss>
